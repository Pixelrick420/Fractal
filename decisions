# DATATYPES
    a) simple
        1. int : 64 bit signed integer
        2. float : 64 bit IEEE floating point
        3. char : 32 bit character (UTF 32 encoding)
        4. boolean : true or false (1 bit)
        5. NULL (special type)

    b) iterable
        1. array : fixed size array that can store any single simple data type
        2. list : variable size array that can store any single simple data type
        (strings are basically char arrays or char lists)

    c) complex
        1. user defined structure : has to be fixed size


# MODIFIERS
    1. const : this type of variable has to be assigned a value during initialization and cant be changed. lists and structures cant be const.


# LITERALS
    a) int
        1. 0b1001 -> binary
        2. 0xA -> hexadecimal
        3. 0o24 -> octal
        4. 0d12 or 12 -> decimal

    b) float
        1. 1.2 -> float without exp
        2. 1.5e6 -> float with exp

    c) char
        1. 'a' -> single quoted char
        2. '\n' -> special char

    d) array
        1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> int array
        2. ['a', 'b', 'c'] or "abcd" -> char array (double quote if no [])

    e) list
        1. same as array but declared as :list

# RULES
    1. no implicit type casting. if user does not convert int to float before calculation, then error happens.
        2 / 1.0 -> type error: operands do not match
        (float) 2 / 1.0 -> ok

        :int a = 1.0 -> type error
        :int a = (!int) 1.0 -> ok

    2. static + strong typing. All datatypes must be declared and cannot be changed.

    3. all keywords start with !
        for -> error
        !for -> keyword signifying a for loop

    4. All datatypes will start with :
        :int -> integer datatype
        int -> error

    5. intendation + curly brackets.
        !if (a > b){
        print(a);
        }
        warning: intendation error

        !if (a > b){
            print(a);
        }
        ok

        also the starting curly brace must be on the same line as condition
        !if (a > b)
        {
            print(a);
        }
        warning: improper use of {

        !if (a > b){
            print(a);
        }
        ok

        Users will have to type all code with proper intendation as well as use curly braces. This makes everyones code look identical and more readable.

    5. !start and !end must be used. Only lines of code between those will be considered.

    6. All variables are local. ie, they can only be accessed within the nearest { }
        !if (condition){
            :int a = 0;
        }
        # no a here

        if variable is declared after start without any nesting, then it is global. The compiler will treat !start as { and !end as }

# STANDARD LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
    a) io
        1. print(string with placeholders, ..... as many simple data variables as there are placeholders) -> will print formatted string to console
        2. input(string with placeholders, ..... as many simple data variables as there are placeholders) -> will take user input and match it with the provided string and fill in placeholder variables. Results in error if types dont match


    b) array methods
        1. find
        2. starts (startswith in python)
        2. ends (endswith in python)

    c) list methods
        1. append
        2. pop
        3. insert
        4. find
        5. delete

    e) tbd (file access needed ig + some sort of turtle like thing for 2d graphics)
